# MLH Fellowship Hackathon - Voting Information Project

## For the first-week hackathon project, I wanted to build a webapp that will allow people to find as much useful information on how and where to vote as possible. My gripe with most services that are already doing this is that they only have *some* information and I end up having to go to 2-3 websites to find everything. I'm trying to correct this!

## The Technicals
### This webapp is built on [flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/1.1.x/), a lightweight framework for Python. It also makes heavy usage of an sqlite3 database, something that's included in the github repo! (Warning, it's >32MB and has over somewhere around 200,000 rows.)
